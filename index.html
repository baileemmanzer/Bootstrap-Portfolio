        <p>Hi! I am a passionate Social Media Specialist with a diversified background in content creation, digital marketing, and website development and design.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I love live music, being active and photography. I am a huge live music fanatic and volunteer for Sofar Sounds in Denver. I have played lacrosse since I was about 8 years old and have played floor hockey recreationally for the past two years and LOVE it. I have recently been practicing my digital photography on the side and enjoy portrait photography the most!</p>
        <br>
        <p>When I was a kid, one of my nicknames was "TV Monster". My very first word was Barney. I don't like to consider myself a TV monster anymore, but I am a movie fanatic. My top movies are The Goonies, Midsommar, A Quiet Place, Interstellar and Jurassic Park (the originals).</p>
